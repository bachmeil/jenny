# My Fork

This is my fork of the Jenny repo. It has some minor styling changes and a change to link generation so that it works from the local file system (as opposed to a web server, which Jenny is designed for).

# Jenny

_Jenny_ is a static blog generator. Its aim is to work with minimal requirements and a small footprint while providing some modern conveniences.

- [x] Lightweight default theme
- [x] Markdown with Footnotes support, care of a modified [md2html.awk](https://bitbucket.org/yiyus/md2html.awk)
- [x] Basic pagination with fixed page numbers
- [x] Plug your own Markdown parser
- [x] Heredocs-based template syntax
- [x] Draft/ignore support (by leaving out the date)
- [x] Forward-posting, i.e. ignores posts with dates in the future
- [x] Tags support
- [x] Modifiable installation prefix
- [x] Define run-time settings in command arguments
- [x] Include static directories in build
- [x] Unique URL slug generation
- [x] Render only changed or new posts
- [x] RSS/Atom feed
- [ ] Tests


## Usage

Install Jenny to your local bin folder.

```
make install
```

Prepare the directory for your blog posts.

```
mkdir -p ~/blog && cd ~/blog
```

Use the subcommand below to initialize your blog folder with a `.blogrc` file and a sample first post.

```
jenny init
```

Or you can proceed below to manually initialize your blog folder.

### Manual Initialization

_You can skip this step if you ran `jenny init`._

Create a configuration file.

```
cat <<EOT >> .blogrc
BLOG_HOST="example.com"
BLOG_TITLE="My Blog"
EOT
```

Create a file with a date so that Jenny recognizes it as a published post.

```
cat <<EOT >> "$(date +%Y-%m-%d) hello-world.md"
# Hello World

Jenny is a static blog generator using bash, sed, and awk.
EOT
```

### Generate

Run `jenny` on your blog directory.

## Command Line Arguments

To override `.blogrc` settings at run-time use command line arguments. Other options are also available, use `jenny -h` to display the message below:

```
jenny usage:
   -d ./dir   Override the build directory setting
   -p 10      Override posts per page setting
   -l ./dir   Override layout directory setting
   -m mmd     Override the markdown parser command setting
   -v         Display more information during building
   -n         Ignore the .bloglock file when building
   -c         Empty out the build folder prior to building
   -h         Show this help message
```

### Handy Shortcuts

```bash
# Publish file with current date
jenny publish filename.md

# Edit file without typing date/full filename
jenny edit partial-filename
```

## Other Settings

To install into a custom location do: ```make install [PREFIX=~/.local]```

To soft install or symlink into your bin folder: ```make sym-install [PREFIX=~/your/path]```

To uninstall, in the project folder run: ```make uninstall```

To configure posts per page:

```
cat <<EOT >> .blogrc
POSTS_PER_PAGE=10
EOT
```

To use your own markdown parser, set `MARKDOWN_COMMAND`:

```
cat <<EOT >> .blogrc
MARKDOWN_COMMAND=multimarkdown
EOT
```

To run a script after the build process, write a `post_hook` function in .blogrc:

```
cat << EOF >> .blogrc
function post_hook() {
  echo "Done!"
}
EOF
```

To set a different build folder, set `DIST`:

```
cat << EOF >> .blogrc
DIST=~/blog/.dist
EOF
```

## Post Formatting

Titles are Markdown H1s. Use Multimarkdown footnotes syntax.

To use tags add the below into a post where `tagname` is both filename and URL friendly:

```
tags: tagname anothertag
```

## Customization

From the project folder, copy the layout folder contents and modify to your liking, mind the template tags.

```cp -R ./share/jenny/layout ~/blog/.layout```

Let Jenny know where to find your customized layout files.

```
cat <<EOT >> .blogrc
LAYOUT_DIR=~/blog/.layout
EOT
```
